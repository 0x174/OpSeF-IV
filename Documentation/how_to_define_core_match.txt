Do:
print(mask_files)

The name of the example mask to spit is:
000_CP_Mask_0.6_RGBInput_000_Ch_00_muscle_blue-2.tif


The parts are as follows (between "_"):
0   1   2    3     4      5  6   7  8 = muscle 9 = blue-2.tif
000_CP_Mask_0.6_RGBInput_000_Ch_00_muscle_blue-2.tif

We want to use 8 & 9 as unquique search string.

Thus core_match = [8:10]
