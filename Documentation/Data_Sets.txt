Description of datasets

Cobblestones dataset
Images of cobblestones were taken with a Samsung Galaxy S6 Active Smartphone.
 
Leaves
Noise was added to the demo data from “YAPiC - Yet Another Pixel Classifier”

Small fluorescent nuclei datasets
Images of Hek293 human embryonic kidney stained with a nuclear dye from the image set BBBC038v1 [Ref 1] 
available from the Broad Bioimage Benchmark Collection (BBBC). Metadata is not available for this image 
set to confirm staining conditions. Images were rescaled from 360 x 360 pixel to 512 x 512 pixel.

3D colon tissue dataset
We used low-signal to noise variant of the image set BBBC027 [Ref 2] from the BBBC.

Epithelial cells dataset
Images of cervical cells from the image set BBBC038v1 [Ref 1] available from the BBBC. 
Cells were stained with a dye that labels membranes weakly and nuclei strongly. 
The staining pattern is reminiscent of images of methylene blue stained cells. 
However, metadata is not available for this image set to confirm staining conditions. 

Skeletal muscle dataset
A methylene blue stained skeletal muscle sections was recorded on a Nikon Eclipse Ni-E microscope equipped with a Märzhäuser SlideExpress2 
system for automated handling of slides. The pixel size is 0.37*0.37 µm. The original, stitched, 44712 x 55444 pixel large image was used 
as template for manual extraction of thirteen patches (2048 x 2048 pixel). After conversion to grey scale these patches were separated in 
two batches: train containing two images and the test dataset.

Kidney dataset
A HE stained kidney paraffin sections were recorded on a Nikon Nikon Eclipse Ni-E microscope equipped with a Märzhäuser SlideExpress2 
system for automated handling of slides. The pixel size is 180 x 180 nm. The original, stitched, 34816 x 51200 pixel large image was 
used as template for manual extraction of two large patches (18432 x 6144 and 22528 x 5120 pixel). Next, the Eosin staining was extracted
using the Color Deconvolution ImageJ plugin. This plugin implements the method described by Ruifrok and Johnston [Ref 3]. After conversion to
greyscale smaller patches for initial training were prepared manually.
