	The naming scheme is as follows:

	Combined_Object_$Data_Analysis_ID_$Search_Term_you_used_to_filter_results.csv
	Contains all combined results per object.

	Results_$Mask_Filename_$Intensity_Image_filename.csv
	Contains results per object for the defined pair of images.

	Combined_Object_Data_Analysis_ID_$Data_Analysis_ID_$Search_Term_you_used_to_filter_results.csv
	Contains all post-processed results per image (e.g. cell number, mean intensity, ect.)
